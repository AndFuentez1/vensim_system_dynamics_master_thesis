# vensim_system_dynamics_master_thesis
This repository contains the Vensim code developed for my Master's degree thesis, which models and simulates the expansion of the Colombian electric power system. The objective is to analyze long-term dynamics, evaluate policy scenarios, and support decision-making in energy planning.

The energy transition has driven the diversification of the electricity matrix through the incorporation of renewable sources and the development of infrastructure aimed at reducing the carbon footprint. This transformation requires the coordination of renewable capacity integration, decentralized generation, storage systems (batteries), and consideration of the long planning and execution timelines for generation and transmission projects.

Achieving efficient power system planning represents a complex challenge. In this context, a system dynamics model is proposed as a tool to analyze the effects of incorporating new technologies, as well as the timelines associated with the development of transmission and generation projects on the evolution of the power system.

The results show how modeling distributed resources, battery storage, congestion, profitability-based decisions, and particularly construction times and potential delays influence system expansion, impacting capacity, price, and reliability. Construction times and delays in particular significantly affect the availability of generation and transmission resources, which in turn influences price formation, investment decisions, and the final configuration of the power system.

Proposals aimed at overcoming expansion barriers—such as proactive planning, reducing execution times, and implementing incentives for solar and solar-plus-battery projects—demonstrated that these measures contribute to accelerating installed capacity expansion, increasing system resilience, and ensuring greater reliability of electricity supply. However, applying these strategies may involve trade-offs in relevant aspects such as end-user tariffs, overall system cost, and long-term sustainability.
